      <h1>Are you maximizing your school's potential?</h1>
      <p>Student’s expectations regarding their education are at an all-time high. When social media and online access allow a student to receive feedback and referrals at the tips of their fingers surrounding an educational institution, schools are under pressure to deliver an exceptional experience to maintain their reputation and ensure future enrollments. There is a heightened level of awareness amongst society when it comes to proprietary education, and every institution needs to ask themselves – Are you delivering on your promises of a quality training program?</p>

      <p>Scotoma (&ldquo;Sco-to-ma&rdquo;): A partial loss of vision or a blind spot in an otherwise normal visual field.
      What this means – You operate your business to the best of your ability, and sometimes you try hard to improve your success rate with little to no impact on the outcome. Our service provides a bird’s eye view of areas within your school that are not reaching their potential – it brings light to the Scotomas within your organization. We then offer solutions and a sustainment plan to maintain momentum throughout your educational facility.</p>
